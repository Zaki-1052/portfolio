## Abstract

BAP1 is a tumor-suppressor gene that removes the histone modification H2AK119ub, traditionally understood to mediate gene repression. Its loss causes severe neurodevelopmental defects including epilepsy, but how it shapes the three-dimensional folding of the genome has never been characterized in the brain. Given that H2AK119ub has been found to modulate active enhancer levels, we used Hi-C to map the physical contacts of DNA regions. We found genome-wide chromatin interactions to be perturbed in the BAP1 mutant, where 1 in 5 detected chromatin loops were dysregulated in the adult mouse cerebellum. At over 200 loci, long range loops associated with repression were preferentially lost in exchange for shorter range contacts. Additionally, the presence of H2AK119ub strongly predicted this distance-dependent loop-loss: if the histone modification was present at an anchor, contacts were ten times more likely to become disrupted. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed repression of developmental and synaptic genes where connections to enhancers were broken. This effect was progressive over neurodevelopment, expanding from under 200 differential loops in early development to almost three thousand in adulthood. These findings indicate that BAP1 is required for organization of the 3D genome in the developing brain, and its loss leads to architectural changes resulting in dysregulated synaptic gene expression. We propose that elevation of H2AK119ub, as a result of BAP1 loss, collapses long-range developmental loops, replacing them with proximal repressive contacts.

## Introduction (145 words)

BAP1 is a tumor suppressor that removes the histone modification H2AK119ub, traditionally understood to mediate gene repression. Its loss causes severe neuro-developmental defects including epilepsy, but how it shapes the three-dimensional folding of the genome has never been characterized in the brain. K119ub is part of the Polycomb system, which also organizes chromatin conformation.

At Polycomb-repressed domains, PRC1 deposits the mark and BAP1 removes it; this cycling is thought to maintain long-range genomic contacts. At active enhancers, BAP1 continuously clears the mark to keep regulatory elements functional. DNA folds into loops that then connect these enhancers to their target genes, so disruption at either type of site could rewire gene regulation and affect expression.

We used Hi-C to map genome-wide chromatin contacts in BAP1-knockout and wildtype mouse cerebellum across development, and clustered all 39,344 detected loops by how much they changed in strength between conditions.

## Methods (94 words)

We performed Hi-C in BAP1-knockout and wildtype mouse cerebellum (n = 3 per condition) at two separate developmental timepoints: P12 and adult. Differential loops were identified using mariner and edgeR with replicate-aware statistical testing across three different resolutions (5, 10, and 25 kb). Loop anchors and spans were then annotated with ChromHMM trained on five CUT&RUN histone marks. All 39,344 detected loops were clustered by contact frequencies (k-means, k = 6) to identify groups of dysregulated chromatin loops. We analyzed strength changes combined with CUT&RUN and RNA-seq to assess the effects on gene expression.

## Conclusions (93 words)

BAP1 loss disrupts chromatin loops through two different simultaneous mechanisms. Gained proximal loops form by compaction within Polycomb domains, where repressive chromatin invades both the loop anchors and body. At lost loops, Polycomb marks accumulate at formerly active anchors, but the span stays euchromatic. This effect is progressive: 165 differential loops at P12 grows to 2,910 in adulthood. These epigenetic changes break enhancer-gene connections at synaptic and developmental loci, which potentially causes a severe phenotype of inhibited neuro-development in BAP1-deficient mice. Our research aims to explore BAP1's importance for the 3D genome architecture.

# Proposal
## Background

BAP1 encodes a tumor-suppressive deubiquitinase that removes H2AK119ub, a Polycomb-deposited histone modification that silences genes. Its loss causes severe neurodevelopmental defects including epilepsy, but how it shapes DNA methylation in the brain is wholly unknown. When BAP1 is absent, H2AK119ub accumulates genome-wide and chromatin compacts, reducing overall accessibility (Conway et al., 2021). In the brain, DNA carries two functionally distinct modifications: 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which represses transcription, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is generated when TET enzymes oxidize 5mC in the first step of active demethylation. Cerebellar neurons contain the highest 5hmC of any mammalian cell type, approximately 40% of modified cytosines (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009). This makes the cerebellum especially dependent on the 5mC/5hmC balance, and especially vulnerable when that balance is disrupted. Despite this, no study has simultaneously profiled both modifications in any BAP1-KO model, and no similar methylation study exists in brain tissue (Parmar et al., 2025). This project will ask how BAP1 loss disrupts active demethylation in neurons, and whether the resulting changes converge with the three-dimensional chromatin remodeling we have independently identified in the same system.

## Goal

This project will primarily validate and extend preliminary methylation findings using an expanded sample size, with biological replicates and deeper sequencing that resolve current statistical limitations. Secondarily, we will integrate methylation data with chromatin loop architecture and histone modification peaks to determine whether epigenetic and structural changes can be causally linked to the chromatin conformation consequences of BAP1 loss. Lastly, we intend to computationally test predictions of a dual-mechanistic hypothesis, in which H2AK119ub accumulation simultaneously recruits DNA methyltransferases and impedes TET-mediated demethylation at the same developmental loci.

## Significance

No previous BAP1 study has profiled both 5mC and 5hmC, and no BAP1 methylation study has been conducted in brain tissue. This is despite 5hmC being unusually abundant in neurons and critical for gene regulation. TET-mediated 5hmC production is required for cerebellar neuron differentiation (Stoyanova et al., 2021), and 5hmC loss in Purkinje cells drives neurodegeneration (Jiang et al., 2015), so our observed disruption in DNA methylation is likely to be the cause of functional dysregulation. Affected genes are enriched for neurodegenerative disease pathways including spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that altered methylation from BAP1 loss may contribute to neuronal vulnerability, in addition to developmental and synaptic changes. By linking opposing DNA methylation trends to three-dimensional genome architecture in the same genetic model, this work connects Polycomb chromatin biology in the field of Hi-C to dual-epigenetic methylation dynamics in neurons. This is a gap that current literature does not address, and has novel implications for studying the role of BAP1-associated neurodegeneration in mice.


## Work

Since joining the Ferguson Lab in September 2025, I have built the computational infrastructure for both arms of this project, beginning with Hi-C chromatin conformation, and in December 2025, for dual-epigenetic methylation sequencing. For the methylation side, I developed a 22-section analysis pipeline for Biomodal DUET evoC data. The technology quantifies both 5mC and 5hmC simultaneously at 6-base-pair resolution, calling differentially methylated regions. My pipeline takes these base-level calls through chromatin state annotation using matched CUT&RUN peaks, and integrates with ATAC-seq (accessibility), RNA-seq (gene expression), and further histone modification data. In the initial sample set, we identified a coordinated pattern, in which 5mC increases while 5hmC decreases at the same gene body loci. This trend currently appears to affect 6,750 loci with 85% concordance among co-significant genes. Gene bodies are the primary affected compartment (42% of genes significant for 5mC, 47% for 5hmC) while promoters show almost no change (<0.2%), consistent with the known enrichment of 5hmC in neuronal gene bodies (Szulwach et al., 2011; Mellén et al., 2017). Synaptotagmin-1, the primary calcium sensor for fast neurotransmitter release, is the most affected gene (+18% mC, −15% hmC), and has been noted for its clear epigenetic changes in past experiments.

Furthermore, when we examine the presence of ubiquitinated histone, we see that H2AK119ub gain co-occurs with hypermethylation (Fisher's OR = 4.40), while these loci are biased toward transcriptional downregulation, and are inversely correlated with chromatin accessibility. Together, these results are consistent with a dual-mechanism model, in which H2AK119ub accumulation both recruits DNMT3A/B to accessible gene bodies via its ubiquitin-recognition domain (Gretarsson et al., 2024), and globally reduces TET enzyme efficiency or access (López-Moyado et al., 2019). I also developed a parallel differential chromatin loop pipeline for Hi-C data from the same BAP1-KO model, which identified 2,910 dysregulated loops, and showed progressive architectural remodeling from early postnatal development to adulthood (18x increase). Because the initial cohort has the limitation of two samples per condition, and sex is confounded with genotype, we will sequence two additional biological replicates each, and intend to double the read count in order to reduce noise from a lower sequencing depth.

## Methods

The full dataset (n=4 per genotype) will be processed through the established pipeline with additional analyses planned dependent on exploratory results. Differential methylation calling will also incorporate batch as a covariate, and determine significance of MeCP2 binding affinity. To connect methylation changes to three-dimensional genome structure, I will test whether genes with the coordinated hyper-methylation and hypo-hydroxymethylation pattern are enriched at the differential loop anchors identified in our Hi-C analysis, using continued Fisher’s exact tests and logistic regression to quantify any association between methylation direction and chromatin remodeling. To test predictions of the dual-mechanism model, I will evaluate whether gene-body hypermethylation continues to track with local H2AK119ub levels, consistent with DNMT3A/B recruitment via its ubiquitin-dependent domain (Conway et al.; Gretarsson et al.); or whether it occurs independently, consistent with global TET impediment. 

All computation will use SDSC Expanse through existing ACCESS allocations, implemented in R/Bioconductor, Python, and Bash. Weeks 1-3 will refine the expanded pipeline, investigate the detection of non-CG methylation with bisulfite sequencing, and perform upstream processing of the new batch. Weeks 4-6 will proceed to run differential methylation analysis with a full cohort, and update current results. Remaining time will be dedicated to further downstream analysis.
